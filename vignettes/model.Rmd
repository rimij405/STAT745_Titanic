## Modelling Passenger Survival

### Logistic Regression (with `glm`)

### Feature Importance (with `randomForest`)

### Classification Tuning (with Cross-Validation)

We can also perform a two-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test to see if 


We can also perform the two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test to see if there's a change in `Survived` based on `PassengerId`.

```
Titanic.alive <- Titanic.train %>%
  dplyr::filter(Survived == "Survived") %>%
  dplyr::pull(PassengerId)
Titanic.dead <- Titanic.train %>%
  dplyr::filter(Survived == "Died") %>%
  dplyr::pull(PassengerId)
(wt <- wilcox.test(Titanic.alive, Titanic.dead))
writeLines(sprintf("Significant (P-value < 0.05)? %s", wt$p.value < 0.05))
```

```
(kt <- kruskal.test(Survived ~ Pclass, Titanic.train))
writeLines(c("null hypothesis: groups are from identical populations",
             "alternative hypothesis: at least one group is from a different population",
             sprintf("Significant (P-value < 0.05)? %s", kt$p.value < 0.05)))
```
